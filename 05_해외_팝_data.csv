I, I just woke up from a dream

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night

And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only one worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow

This is gonna hurt but I blame myself first, 
cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off that love, my head up, 
there's no forgetting you

You've awoken me, 
but you're choking me, I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, 
and now honestly I've got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air 
that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed 
that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion 
ruined me
Baby I loved you dangerously
Mmmm, mmm, mmmm
I loved you dangerously-woah

Usually I hold the power with both 
my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things change, 
cause now you're the train, 
and I'm tied to the track

You've awoken me, 
but you're choking me, I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me,
and now honestly I've got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air 
that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed 
that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion
ruined me
Baby I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips quick goodbye
I see you now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, 
there's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline
I love you, I love you, I love you, 
I loved you dangerously
More than the air
that I breathe
Oh now, I knew we would crash 
at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion

I'm avoiding every mistletoe until
I know it's true love

Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up
and you wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is
just a fling or if it's true love
That he thinks of

Screamed in the kitchen

I used to be mad but now I know
Sometimes it's better to let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet

Why they could never be happy

For a whole 'nother family
Where everything was fine

I won't even wish for snow

Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Oh Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You~ baby~

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
the one I really need Won't you
please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

and thought that it was closure
But you still tell me that you need me
Baby why tell me why
Can't you just make up your mind
Quit messing with my head
You can't say you hate me 
then call me when you're hurt
Baby you know that's not how this works (no)

You can't walk away

Stop reminding me of when we said forever
I know exactly what you're doing
When you say you need to drop off 
all my sweaters
It's just one of your excuses
Baby why tell me why
Can't you just make up your mind
Quit messing with my head
You can't say you hate me then call me

Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think
I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though lord knows you kept mine
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think
I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think
I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You say I'm crazy

Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oooooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like oooooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

In my mind, I'm driving reckless
I'm scared to forget your face
Now I'm starting to cry, it's time for goodbye
What a life you threw my way
My love, I hope to see you again one day

Oh
Oh

You're rainin' on leaves, I want you to snow (Want you to snow)
I'm raisin' my voice, you're tellin' me, ""No""
Oh, don't mean to be cross, just want you to know (Oh)
I'm scared of the day I let your hand go (Oh)

It's hard to see with broken glassеs (Oh)

And then I keep ya held down 
when I lock n drop it
Yeah you be sly

Playing that hard to get love 
Showing no affection
I know it's hard to keep up 
with my good intentions

they must think I'll never leave ya
I don't see my love as weakness
I know in the end you'll be the one, one, one

Right now I bet you think 
you've got me in the palm of your hands
Give me no love you get that good love
Hope that you don't regret

from your lip

with my little finger
and I would do it all day just to let you linger

to let you ride

hoping that youre learning real quick

Waiting for the light to take us in

Than the last four cold Decembers

And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night
I think I might have it all 
And I thank god everyday 
For the girl he sent my way 
But I know the things he gives me
He can take away 
And I hold you every night
That's a feeling I wanna get used to 
But there's no man as terrified 
As the man who stands to lose you 
Oh I hope I don't lose you

Trying everything I can like meditating
Keeping myself busy down to every second

What could've been like you and I

That until now existed only in my mind
I'll set the table for two people
But you know 
our friends will always be welcome anytime
And maybe I won't say ""I love you"" 
'Cause you always say these words 
Only work in a pop song
But I know this home is yours 
And is where we both belong

So when the spring will come
We'll let the sun flood in
You'll close your eyes
It's summer, dancing on your skin
And when the autumn knocks
Impatient at our door
We'll get ready for winter
With covers on the floor

One window will be showing the sea
The second will be filled up with trees
We'll use the third to follow the stars
The last one will who reflect who we are
Who we are
Who we are
Who we are
Who we are

I know maybe I'm too early in the game
And they say to sit around and wait
But what if one day 
I wake up and look you in the eye 
And realize it's too late
We would look at tiny feet 
And say that she is like a dream
And the three of us would be family

So when the spring will come
We'll let the sun flood in
You'll close your eyes
It's summer, dancing on your skin
And when the autumn knocks
Impatient at our door
We'll get ready for winter

When I walked you home
That's when I nearly said it
But then said 'Forget it' and froze
Do you remember?
You probably don't
'Cause the sparks in the sky
Took a hold of your eyes
while we spoke
Yesterday,
drank way too much
And stayed up too late
Started to write what I wanna say
'Deleted the message'
But I still remember it said
I wish I was who you drunk texted
at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up till 3
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you
walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside
April the 7th
And nothing has changed
It's hard to get by
When you're still on my mind every day
Sometimes I question
If you feel the same?
Do we make stupid jokes?
Trying to hide that we're both too afraid
to say
I wish I was who you drunk texted
at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up till 3
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you
walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside
Oh, and here we go again
Destroy myself to keep a friend
Hiding away
'cause I was afraid you'd say no
I wonder if I cross your mind
Half as much as you do mine
If I tell you the truth
What will I lose?
I don't know
I wish I had sent you that drunk text
at midnight
I was just scared it would ruin our friendship
But I really meant it
I wonder how you would reply

Dancing like you're still mine

There you are just spinning around me

I pulled her in and I said

I want you baby
You want me too
Put my hands all over you
I need you baby

Where you got freckles and scars
And the terrible tattoo you got

When I feel like numbing my pain

Didn't expect to be feeling this numb
What have I done

I wanna grow to be someone I love
Look in the mirror and feel like enough
Now all the damage is done
'Cause I'm two shades blonder and still no fun

I casted out my demons, by emotional eating
Now I don't fit my favorite clothes
I miss multiple exes, tonight I'll probably text them
To pretend I'm not so alone

Jenny knows what kind of color I want
Didn't expect to be feeling this numb
What have I done

I wanna grow to be someone I love
Look in the mirror and feel like enough
Now all the damage is done

Ripping out pages in Vogue magazine
Should I try copper or aquamarine
This platinum princess is still dead inside
Whoever said blondes have more fun fucking lied

Just a one night stand
I'll be damned cupid's
Demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and
God tell us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season
And the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me if we're not careful
Turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best
Memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe
We'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and
God tell us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season
And the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same
God give us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season
And this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name

Got, got it if you want it

Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that you'll smile and gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karat
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (Is it you?) Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

52,For Sale Sign (feat. Lizzy McAlpine),Tiny Habits,"I used to see you
In the garden
Through the window of a TV room
I used to wake up
To your engine hummin'

You'd leave a light on
In the attic
I could see it from my room
And I used to wonder
What the rest of your house looked like

And if you ever let anyone else inside

There's a lot of
People I thought would live
Live forever
I think you were one of them

Mm, mm

Had my first heartbreak
Back in high school
You saw me crying in the driveway
The look on your face said
You had had one too

I had always been so curious about you (About you)

There's a lot of
People I thought would live
Live forever
I think you were one of them
There's a lot of
People I thought would live
Live forever
I swore you were one of them

I think a lot
About all the people everyone forgot
Letters on stones
Are you better off gone
When you're leaving nobody behind? (Oh)

I hope to God
You got let off easy
And that there's someone (Oh)
Out there just waiting for you just to arrive
I look at the sky sometimes
And think about endings

There's a lot of
People I thought would live
Live forever
I think you were one of them
There's a lot of
People I thought would live
Live forever
I swore you were one of them

Now nobody's tending to the garden
All the flowers died
They tore down the fence and
They put up a for sale sign

54,Cordelia,Flower Face,"I would buy a gun, and I'd take any pill
If I knew it would bring me to you but I don't think that it will
It doesn't make me angry, I don't feel that anymore
I'm never disappointed cause I've seen this place before
I think I saw you in the city, you looked paranoid and thin
Your face betrayed the weather, I could see it on your skin
I think I found our constellation, I can see it from your house
They say the stars are dying but so is everybody else

Now I wake up every morning waiting for the day to end
Measuring the shadows that I carved out of my hands
My saviour's in a bottle and he keeps my edges soft
His sympathy's relentless while I let my insides rot
Cause I don't think that you're waiting anymore

Do you think someone would tell us if we made some grave mistake?
All our buried conversations, our forgiveness came too late
Now it's someone else's secrets on the collar of your shirt
It doesn't make a difference, it just makes my stomach hurt
I think I heard you on the radio, you sounded like a star
Now everybody loves you but they don't know who you are
They say you don't have any manners cause they didn't raise you right
But the world has been so cruel, how could you bear to be polite?

For a moment you looked wounded, then you walked right out the door
Living in a movie, I collapsed against the wall
That fatalistic summer, you turned the tide on me
I swallowed my heart and chased my shadow down the street
When I'm feeling tragic, it's all I think about
If you feel it once then you can never go without
Some kind of revelation that leaves you terrified
I think that I am evil, I could kill you if I tried
But I don't dream about it anymore

We could go anywhere we could do
Anything girl whatever the mood we're in
All I know is ooh ooh ooh
Getting lost late at night under stars
Finding love standing right 
Where we are your lips
They pull me in the moment 
You and I alone and
People may be watching I don't mind
'Cause

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain

I look at you now 
And I want this forever
I might not deserve it 
But there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever 
Did it all without you
My heart is about to 
About to jump out of my chest
Feelings they come 
And they go that they do
Feelings they come 
And they go not with you
The late nights and the street lights 
And the people look at me girl 
And the whole world could stop

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain oh

Girl when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
So come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight
Days in Paris nights in Paris
Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes
Yeah isn't it obvious isn't it obvious?
Come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight

'Cause anywhere with you feel right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Walking down an empty street
Puddles underneath our feet

Had to make a choice, either her or my dreams
And I felt her love on the road, but that was a long time ago
I fell for the wrong girl, the type to start a fire
And leave you there to burn
And I found a way to stay alive
But somethin' in me that day died

[Pre-Chorus]
How does anyone make it out better?
Someone tell me the words I should say
How does anyone keep it forever?
I barеly made it through yesterday

[Chorus]
I wish I could lovе like I used to love
I wish I could love like when I was young
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's gettin' harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what I gotta change
No matter what I do, it always ends the same
And I'm not givin' up yet
But I don't got a whole lot left
[Pre-Chorus]
How does anyone make it out better?
Someone tell me the words I should say
How does anyone keep it forever?
I barely made it through yesterday

[Chorus]
I wish I could love like I used to love
I wish I could love like when I was young
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's gettin' harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah, the less I cry
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah, the less I cry

[Chorus]
I wish I could love like I used to love
I wish I could love like when I was young
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's gettin' harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry
[Post-Chorus]
The older I get, the less that I cry, the less that I feel, I'm not gonna cry (Ooh-ooh, ah-ah, the less I cry)
The older I get, the less that I cry, the less that I feel, I'm not gonna cry (Ooh-ooh, ah-ah, the less I cry)

[Outro]
I wish I could love like I used to love
I wish I could love like when I was young
It's gettin' easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away

I just couldn't sympathize
With cards on Valentine's Day
And couples who say 'babe'

And unrealistic expectations

And I might regret it but I'll take the hit

I don't mind a little cheese

You're a dream come true
You're the bread to my butter
The shade to my summer
I wanna be together
I love you three thousand
More than the highest mountain
You're the sun in my sky
The apple of my eye
All I want is you and I
I never thought I was sentimental
But I guess I always had the potential
I think I had a feeling from the start
When you became the match to my spark
So even if you're not in the mood
I'll feed it to you on a silver spoon
I hope it don't make you feel queasy
'Cause I'm about to get real cheesy

listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it darling
you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman
stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams
I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love
to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love
to carry children of our own
We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand
Be my girl I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby I'm dancing in the dark

looking so beautiful

72,Home,Bruno Major(브루노 메이저) CONNECT 아티스트,"There's no life, without love they say
None worth having anyway, 
you're a mystery to me some days
But that's what keeps me sane, 
the heart that yearns is always young, 
but you can't love just anyone, 
it's been a while since 21, 
but I still feel the same

So take me home, don't spare the horses
Away to the silence I need
Take me home, don't spare the horses
Away to a gossamer breeze
I don't need to build a house of stone
Cause wherever you are's where I call home

Cause we're just you me, 
can drink and laugh and dance 'till 3
Cause I have everything I need, 
when I'm with you alone
Home is where we stay all night, 
no roof above our starry sky
I'd lie here 'till the day I die, 
and our time together's flown

So take me home, don't spare the horses
Away to the silence I need
Take me home, don't spare the horses
Away to a gossamer breeze
I don't need to build a house of stone
Cause wherever you are's where I call home

And I know I've made mistakes at times, 
every now and then I've made you cry, 
for that I'm sorry, 
but they were few and far between, 
we're closer now than we've ever been, 
and you know I'm sorry

I used to wonder, why I'm here, 
no rhyme no reason would appear, 
but since we've met, it's loud and clear, 
I'm here to see you, home

Stay a while""

Well I have a fun idea babe (Uh-huh) 
maybe just stay inside
I know you're craving some fresh air 
but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice right?)
And we could live so happily 
if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding 
but really (Kinda) really really

Please please please 
(Please don't prove I'm right)
Don't prove I'm right

If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically

88,Anti-Hero,Taylor Swift(테일러 스위프트),"I have this thing where I get older
But just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
At teatime everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
(I'm the problem it's me)
At teatime everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero
I have this dream my daughter in law kills me
For the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers around and reads it
And then someone screams out
'She's laughing up at us from hell'
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
It's me hi
Everybody agrees everybody agrees
It's me hi (Hi)
I'm the problem it's me (I'm the problem it's me)
At teatime (Teatime)
Everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero

I'll take you to LAX and beg you to extend
Your vacation for just one or two more days
Girl, I know that you'll be back
'Cause, when you say, ""Goodbye"", you say it with a little laugh
But you're gonna miss your American boy and his American ways

Why I can't move on

come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't want to know

素肌にキラキラ珊瑚礁
二人っきりで流されてもいゝの
あなたが好き

あゝ青い風切って走れあの島へ

涙がこぼれるの
やさしい目をして見ないで
うつ向き加減の Little Rose
花びら触れて欲しいの

二人の頬が近づいてゆくのよ

94,Snow Globe (Feat. Marle Thomson),Anthony Lazaro,"You walk into the room
People can't help it
They're staring at you
Frozen in place
Cause they have never seen
A woman who shines like a queen
And I can't believe
This stunning creature is dancing with me
Maybe I'm dreaming but what do I care
As long as the dream is still there
So why are you hanging around someone like me
Nowhere near perfect and I'll never be
I can be trouble and I change moods like
Tides of the sea
But if you feel like sticking around
I'll wrap us up in a globe of this town
And let the snow fall, while I'm kissing you
And look at those eyes
Bright as two stars fallen down from the sky
Two perfect hands softly gliding around
A tender voice floating in sound
So why are you hanging with someone like me
Nowhere near perfect and I'll never be
I can be trouble and I change moods like
Tides of the sea
But if you're feeling like sticking around
I'll wrap us up in a globe of this town
And let the snow fall, while I'm kissing you

95,My Love Mine All Mine,Mitski CONNECT 아티스트,"Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shining down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you
So when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you
’Cause my love is mine all mine
I love, my my mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine all mine all mine
My baby here on earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her
’Cause my love is mine all mine
I love, my my mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine all mine all mine

since I saw your face that night
It took 5 seconds to fall in love 
and 2 more to make you mine

suns set and 7 minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by, I love you 24/7, 365

Give you my name, if you wanted to
Key to my heart if you want it too
And I hope and pray that you'll stay right here
'til we're old and gray in our last few years
I'm on a knee I just need a yes
A couple kids and a picket fence
Share the memories like an open book
Every page I read it still got me hooked

And I'm fine spending my whole life 
on everything you like
Is it obvious that all of this is right? 

Cause it's been 3 years and 6 whole months

I'll wipe your tears when you're in your feels
And I'll hold you close through a thunderstorm
When it's cold at night know i'll keep you warm

97,Out of Time,The Weeknd(위켄드),"Yeah yeah
The last few months
I've been workin' on me baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones
who loved me baby
I look back now and I realize
And I remember when I held you
You begged me
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you girl but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make
you mine out of time (Ah)
If he mess up just a little
Baby you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back girl come right back
Give me one chance just a little
Baby I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like
I shoulda loved you all the time
And I remember
when I held you (Held you baby)
You begged me
with your drowning eyes to stay
(Never again baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you (Hey)
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind (Uh)
Say I love you girl but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make
you mine out of time (Ah)
Ooh singin' out of time
Said I had you to myself but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine out of time
Out of time
Out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says you are out of time
You're almost there but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed
in the blissful embrace of that
little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed forgiven and refreshed
Free from all trauma pain guilt and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy listening to
some slow tracks

98,High Hopes,Panic! At The Disco(패닉 앳 더 디스코),"Had to have high high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars
When I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high high hopes
Had to have high high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high high hopes
Mama said
Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything wanted everything
Mama said
Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories everyday
We wanted everything wanted everything
Mama said don't give up
It's a little complicated
All tied up no more love
And I'd hate to see you waiting
Had to have high high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars
When I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high high hopes

It's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders
Ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don't ever change
We wanted everything wanted everything
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down
Mama said don't give up
It's a little complicated
All tied up no more love
And I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done
But they haven't seen the best of me
So I got one more run

99,Someone Like You,Adele(아델),"I heard That you're settled down
That you found a girl?
And you're married now
I heard
That your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend
Why are you so shy
It ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue
Uninvited
But I couldn't stay away
I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded
That for me
It isn't over

Never mind I'll find
Someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Too Don't forget me
I beg I remember you say
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

You'd know?
How the time flies
Only yesterday
Was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue
Uninvited But I couldn't stay away
I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded
That for me
It isn't over

Never mind I'll find
Someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Too Don't forget me
I beg I remember you say
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares
No worries, or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They're memories made
Who would have known.. How..
Bittersweet?
This would taste

Never mind I'll find
Someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Too Don't forget me
I beg I remember you say
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I'll find
Someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Too Don't forget me
