And I brought my boys with me
Say wat up to Ty Ty, still sipping Malta
Sittin' courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from… 

ALICIA KEYS> 
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York 

JAY-Z> 
I made you hot nigga
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my click though
Welcome to the meltin' pot
Corners where we sellin' rocks
Afrika Bambaataa shit
Home of the hip-hop
Yellow cap, gypsy cap, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
8 million stories out there and their naked
City is a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me I gotta plug special Ed ""I got it made"" 
If Jesus payin' Lebron, I'm paying Dwayne Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three card molly
Labor day parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king yo
I'm from the Empire State that's…

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

JAY-Z> 
Lights is blinding
Girls need blinders 
So they can step out of bounds quick
The side lines is blind with casualties
Who sippin' life casually, then gradually become worse
Don't bite the apple eve
Caught up in the in crowd
Now you're in-style
And in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien 

ALICIA KEYS>

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York

Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York 

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeaa yeaa yeaa yeaa
Come on, come on

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

23,squabble up,Kendrick Lamar(켄드릭 라마),"God knows
I am reincarnated
I was stargazin'
Life goes on, I need all my babies (Gyah, gyah)

Woke up lookin' for the broccoli
High-key, keep a horn on me, that Kamasi
IP, ownership, the blueprint is by me
Mr. Get Off, I get off at my feet
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, now is your chance
A yee nigga couldn't try me in the tri-state
Buddy pass, bet I get him splashed 'til he hydrated
Bounce out, know he spook town, eyes dilated
I got the money and the power both gyratin'

I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safe
Mando, let me know what the play

What the fuck?
I got hits, I got bucks, I got new paper cuts
I got friends, I got foes, but they all sitting ducks
Hit his turf and get crackin', double back like a deluxe
Fifty deep, but it ain't deep enough
Fuck a plea, there he go, beat him up
Fallin' from my money tree and it grow throughout the months
Spit a loogie at the camera, speed off, yeah, it's us

I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste

Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, baby rockin' it
Quid pro quo, what you want? 'Cause I'm watchin' it
Work on the floor, let me know if you clockin' it
Brodie won't go, but I know that he poppin' it
It was woof tickets on sale 'til I silenced it
Pipe down, young, these some whole other politics
Bitch with him and some bitch in him, that's a lot of bitch
Don't hit him, he got kids with him, my apologies
Ghetto child, it was Black & Milds with the Smirnoff
Yeehaw, we outside, whoadie 'bout to kill him off
Blaps on blaps, it's a fact, this a brick of raw
Tell me why the fuck you niggas rap if it's fictional?
Tell me why the fuck you niggas fed if you criminal?
""Ayy, Dot, can I get a drop?"" I'm like, ""Nigga, nah""
Ace boon coon from the Westside to Senegal
It's a full moon, let the wolves out, I been a dog (Ah)

24,Manila,Young Cocoa,"Urban Jungle steppin' on a puddle
Mind race ejaculate
The thoughts that's in the bubble
Workin' for the better 'morrow
Workin' for the payday
Rememberin' the things that's in
The past that's in the heyday
Way way back back when when time right
Sneakers so white white
Comin' through the city
Comin' out just for the night night
Vios got modded and all
And I'm whippin' out
My paper on my favorite stall
Mang nestor feelin' like a Jester
Swervin' so heavy alcohol go up on tester
Pourin' out a bottle just to show
Respect for ones that I love
It's about a little time
I show Manila some love
You know you know you know (Manila)
You know you know you know (Manila)
You know you know you know
You know you know you know
Got a couple hundred in
My pocket tryna' to see ya
Blowin' out my stash
Boutta see if I can re up
Pullin' up in Katip
Boutta see if I can see homie
Got a girl from Alabang
And she gon' be on me
Pullin' up in EDSA swerve down the skyway
Ain't no bad vibes 2020 this is my way
My way or the highway
Pull up in an Angkas
Don't forget to (Skrr skrr)
I don't fuck with Joyrides
Cause they don't respect the worker
Diokno in the biker seat
Got him with a mask and a glove
And I exercise my right
To pay respect to Above
Filipino kid
Just a mix of cultural things
Showin' love to Manila
It's the city of dreams
Yeah slide through with a couple of friends
Jammin' out so heavy
Got the chos in my hands
Grew up in the city call it JKT
With my tempe sauce
and a couple of beats
Flew back to Manila in search of my own
Pay respect to the city
that became my home
You know you know you know (Manila)
You know you know you know (Manila)

25,Lose Yourself,Eminem(에미넴),"Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo his palms are sweaty knees weak
Arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already
Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous but on the surface
He looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth
But the words won't come out
He's choking how?
Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out
Time's up over blaow
Snap back to reality
Ope there goes gravity ope
There goes rabbit he choked
He's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no
He won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
That's when it's
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment
And hope it don't pass him and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
His soul's escaping through
This hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring But superstardom's
Close to post mortem it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him coast to coast shows
He's known as the globetrotter lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther
From home he's no father
He goes home and barely knows
His own daughter
But hold your nose
'Cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo'
He's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
And so the soap opera
Is told it unfolds I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on
Da da dom da dom dah dah dah dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
No more games
I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off
Like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning
The mood all changed
I've been chewed up
And spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin'
And stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right
Type of life for my family
'Cause man these goddamn food stamps
Don't buy diapers
And there's no movie there's no mekhi phifer
This is my life
And these times are so hard
And it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed
Plus teeter totter
Caught up between bein' a father
And a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on her
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only
Motherfuckin' option failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer's got
To go I cannot grow old in salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot Feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to man

Too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain
All I do is complain
She needs something to change
Need to take off the e e edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both actin' insane
But too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again
80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained
Looking over the e e edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart
Then you got it
Turns out that it wasn't
What you wanted
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV?
I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage
Blue diamond no shark
You're barbie life doll
It's nicki minaj
You don't need a key to drive
Your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side
The one that's unbothered
And I don't want ya to never go outside
I promise if they play
My niggas slidin'
I'm fuckin' her and the tour bus still ridin'

Twenty-four seven three sixty-five
pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it alright alright I admit it
Now pick your next move
you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where?
Back to wearing knock-offs?
Haha knock it off Neimans shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais waitress top it off
Hoes like vultures
wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em
they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag every blouse every bracelet
Comes with a price tag baby face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young rich and tasteless P
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave
And I always find
yeah I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit
just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding
what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off

I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger
You would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos
While walking through the park
You would jump into my
Arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets
Sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through
Your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays went to church
On mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone
Sorry that you have to lose me

Calculated promises

Look at me crazy

You the moral to the story you endorsing
Motherfucker I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift

Like you do you do
You kinda feeling like
You're tryna get away from me
If you do I won't move
I ain't just cryin' for no reason
I ain't just prayin' for no reason
I give thanks for the days for the hours
And another way another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life

This a revelation, how to get a nigga gone
You need you a man, baby, I don't understand, baby
Pay your bill and make you feel protected like I can, baby
Teach you somethin' if you need correction, that's the plan, baby
Don't put your life in these weird niggas' hands, baby (Woah)

Hey, black out if they act out, yeah, I did that

Nothing but my children, one shot, they disappearin'
I'm in a city with a flag, be gettin' thrown like it was pass interference
Padlock around the building
Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck just to play freeze tag
With a bone to pick like it was sea bass
So when I made it out, I made about fifty K from a show
Tryna show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope
I'm prophetic, they only talk about it how I get it
Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics
How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?
Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out the plyometric
Nicarana by the lux, soon as I up the highest metric
The city just made it sweet, you could die, I bet it
They mouth get full of deceit, let these cowards tell it
Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of L.A., yellin'

The mandem celebrate Eid 
The trap still running on Christmas Day

Somebody tell doja cat
That I'm tryna indulge in that
In my grey tracksuit see the bulge in that
See the motion clap 
when you're throwing it back
These females planning on doing me wrong
So I'm grabbing the Dom out the Trojan pack
Post the location after were gone
Can't slip and let them know where we're at
I don't know about you but I value my life
Cus imagine I die
And I ain't made 100m yet
so much things I ain't done yet
Like fucking a flight attendant
I don't party but I heard cardi there so fuck it 
I might attend it
Gotta kick back sometimes and wonder
How life would've been 
if I never did take them risks 
and would've I prospered?
Floating and I won't go under
Been out of town for a month
Absence makes the love grow fonder
Uk rap or uk drill
Gotta mention my name 
if you talk bout the genre

(Alright)

How can I be homophobic

of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life 
and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' 
and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks 
that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man 
that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk 
you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' 
and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool I'm the kinda G 
the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night 
sayin' prayers in the streetlight
Been spendin' most their lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life 
I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television 
watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger
And my homies is down 
so don't arouse my anger
Fool death ain't nothin' 
but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Been spendin' most their lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Power and the money money and the power
Minute after minute hour after hour
Everybody's runnin' 
but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen 
but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn 
but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it 
how can they reach me?
I guess they can't I guess they won't
I guess they frontin' that's why 
I know my life is out of luck fool
Been spendin' most their lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives 
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives

Tell me why are we so blind to see

66,Stereo Hearts (feat. Adam Levine),Gym Class Heroes(짐 클래스 히어로즈),"My heart's a stereo
It beats for your, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelve
Will you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I sing a song and the image grab me by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for your, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh To my stereo
Oh oh oh oh So sing along to my stereo

If I was an old school, fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear this, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for your, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh To my stereo
Oh oh oh oh So sing along to my stereo

I only pray you never leave me behind
Because good music can be so hard to find
I'll take your hand and pull it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

[Chorus]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for your, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh To my stereo

75,Greatest Love of All,Whitney Houston(휘트니 휴스턴),"I believe the children are our are future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
Everybody searching for a hero 
People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs 
A lonely place to be 
So I learned to depend on me 

[Chorus:]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 

[Chorus]

And if by chance, that special place 
That you've been dreaming of 
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love

82,Movie,Tom Misch CONNECT 아티스트,"My cheek brushes against his
Smooth on stubble for a moment
And then it's gone
He walks along the platforms into the dream
Every fiber in me wants to shout and scream
'Stop'
To run across to him take him into my arms
To tell him
'I love you you silly silly man I love you'
But instead I stand still
Heart cracking
These little curls on the back
Of his head bouncing
As he steps out of my life forever
I hope
That the fire we both made
Still burns a little in you
I wrote to you
Everyday did my letters find their way?
Our memories on my screen
Two lovers in this mystic dream
Baby come back to me come back to me
Too much time on my phone
Baby do you still sleep alone?
Come back to me come back to me
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
I heard
That you moved somewhere far away
Is your number the same as before?
Can't ignore the time
May have changed your ways
Does my record still hang on your wall?
Such a sentimental way to groove
I hope it still touches you
Baby come back to me come back to me
It kills me to see you leave
So I came home and made this beat
Baby come back to me come back to me
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream

And we can do it on our own
Head up to a place where baby no one goes
In a rocket full of liquor
In a polaroid for pictures
Baby you should stop me 'fore I lose control

And put on your disguise

85,Good News,Mac Miller(맥 밀러),"I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleaning
I'm always too busy dreaming
Well maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret
But I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Well I hate the feeling
When your high but underneath the ceiling
Got the cards in my hand I hate dealing
Get everything I need then I'm gone
But it ain't stealing can I get a break?
I wish that I could just
Get out my god damn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Maybe I'll lay down for a little
Instead of always trying
To figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even
Know what I'm saying it about
Good news good news good news
That's all they wanna hear
No they don't like it when I'm down
When I'm flying it
Make 'em so uncomfortable
So different what's the difference?
Well it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas
Hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
So tired of being so tired
Why do I gotta build something beautiful
Just to go set it on fire?
I'm no lie but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it
So what I do? If you know
Me it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon
Haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the skies still blue
Heard they don't talk about
Me too much no more
That's a problem with a closed door
Good news good news good news
That's all they wanna hear
No they don't like it when I'm down
When I'm flying oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different what's the difference?
That there's a whole lot more
For me waiting on the other side
I'm always wondering
If it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late I could
Make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot
More for me waiting
That there's a whole lot
More for me waiting
I know maybe I'm too late I could
Make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad
Ain't so bad when it ain't that bad
At least it don't gotta be no more
No more no more no more no more

86,The Search,NF(엔에프),"Hey nate how's life?
I don't know it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things
Like every human being
And really didn't sleep much
Last night (Last night)
I'm sorry that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows
And the bus rides yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist and I found out
Somethin' funny's going on up in my house
Yeah started thinkin'
Maybe I should move out
You know pack my car take a new route
Clean up my yard get the noose out
Hang up my heart let it air out (Air out)
I've been searchin'
What does that mean
Nate? I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes leavin' my burdens
Well I brought a few with me
I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey
But hey (But hey)
It's worth it though
Cold world out there kids grab your coats
Been a minute I know now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid I admit it I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me
But I can't condone
Talkin' down to me
I'ma have to crack your nose
For crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope
You seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd
And see so many faces yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup
And drown in self hatred
Forget what I'm saying and
Where'd the beat go?
Oh ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame
And it pumped my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face clean up my vomit
Ocd tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it now y'all done it
I can be critical never typical
Intricate with every syllable I'm a criminal
Intimate but never political pretty visual
Even if you hate it
I'll make it feel like you're in it though
You call me what you wanna
But never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought
I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin'
This cinematic is beautiful
Man I don't know if I'm makin' movies
Or music videos (Videos videos)
Yeah the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though
When your health declines
See we've all got somethin'
That we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate
You know hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater
But it always survives
Then it comes up out of
Nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you
To tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that?
Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is
A powerful place
And what you feed it can
Affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool right? Yeah
But it's not always safe
Just hang with me
This'll only take a moment okay?
Just think about it for a second
If you look at your face
Every day when you get up
And think you'll never be great
You'll never be great
Not because you're not but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up
And murder your faith (Woo)
I am developin' take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with
I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant?
That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement
Then bag it up and give me the evidence
It's pretty evident
Dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman depending on
If I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant but not afraid
To tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette I keep it to myself
When I celebrate ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons
And invite your friends
Seatbelts back on yeah strap 'em in
Look at me everybody I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me tone that down but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound better raise your fists
The search begins I'm back
So enjoy the trip huh (Huh huh)

But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts

So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (Hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
